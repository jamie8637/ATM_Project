Name:
	Michael Wilson
	
Background:
	Software Developer at NetBoss
	About 2 and a half years of experience

Programming languages:
	I know Java, PHP, Javascript, and HTML. 
	I can get by working with C# and C++.
	Lately, I have taken up an interest in Erlang and Scala, but 
	I haven't done anything interesting with these languages yet.

What I hope to get from the course: 
	I hope to gain a better understanding of the software development 
	process.

Something unique:
	Learning new programming languages has made me want to start speaking
	more "human" languages. I have been trying to work through some French
	lessons at home over the summer.
