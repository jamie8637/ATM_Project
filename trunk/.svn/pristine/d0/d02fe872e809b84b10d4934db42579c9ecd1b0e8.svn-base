Keith Wasielewski

I am currently a full time student in my Senior year at UCF. My background
consists of mostly retail jobs, where at one point I owned and sold my own
comic book shop in the Orlando area. From then on, I have been focusing on
college, obtaining first an AA then an AS in Computer Programming and Analysis
from Valencia College. Now I am finishing up my BAS here at UCF.

As for languages, I know Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, and C++. I will be 
learning PHP on my own throughout the semester with time permitting.

Having zero experience so far, I wish to continually work more as a team and
get a feel for the developing environment.

I have a fondness for MMORPGs and a strong fascination with UIs. If I have 
downtime, you will usually find me at the movie theater.
