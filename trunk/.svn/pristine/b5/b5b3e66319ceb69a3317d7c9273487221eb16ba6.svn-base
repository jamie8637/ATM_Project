My name is Pat McAleavey.

I got my AS in Computer Programming from Valencia to get in this program.

The main language I've studied is Java. I've also taken the C#, C, html, javascript courses at Valencia.

I hope to become a much better programmer and become ready to get in the field. There are quite a few 
impressive programmers in this program and my hope is to catch up to some of them.

I spent years in Los Angeles pursuing acting.
