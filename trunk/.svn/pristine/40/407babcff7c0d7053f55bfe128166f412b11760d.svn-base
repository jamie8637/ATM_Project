Currently I'm a Business Analyst. 
I work on projects that vary from strictly gathering business requirements 
to projects where I'm working with IT to implement VMware and MicroStrategy reports (helping to create views in SQL).     
I have 15 years in this field with a mix of projects ranging from strictly business to highly technical.

I have working knowledge (mainly from education) of: C, C++, C#, VB.NET, Java.
I have used the following on the job: XML, HTML, (MS) SQL, Oracle SQL, MicroStrategy, VMware. 

With this course, I hope to increase my knowledge and experience of software development skills through 'real world' applications.
That's what I like about this BAS program - less theory and more application. 

Something unique:
I used to drag race (1/4 mile) - first for fun at the local tracks and later in compet events. 
I had a Mustang (302 ci) with a supercharger and nitrous that had a respectable 1/4 mile time in the low 10 seconds at over 125 mph.
I should add, that was back in the early 90's, which back then was respectable for a 'grocery getter/daily driver' car with a full roll cage.
