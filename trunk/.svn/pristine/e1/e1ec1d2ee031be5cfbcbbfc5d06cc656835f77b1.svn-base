Hello everyone.  My name is Jamie Smith.  My background is actually in electronic
engineering.  I earned my AS in Electronics several years ago and worked in microchip
manufacturing as a senior technician for about a decade.  While I did perform many
mechanical repairs while in manufacturing, I found that I took much greater joy in 
handling the software issues that inevitably came up.  While my associates turned 
those problems over to the vendors, I found myself hanging around and learning how
the systems worked.  This led me to teaching myself C++ during my off time.  Due to 
the decline in American manufacturing, my plant closed, then my next plant closed.  
That's when I decided to go back to school to learn something I could really enjoy.  I 
went back to college and earned my AS in computer Programming.  Now, along with everyone 
else here, I'm on the verge of completing my BAS in Software Development.  I can't wait to 
squeeze all the knowledge I can from these remaining classes and in a mere two semesters, 
become a full time software developer.

So far I have learned Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript.  My favorite so far is
Java. 

From this course I hope to acquire a much better understanding of software development in 
in general.  I also look forward to the group project(s).  The majority of the programs
I've written have been solo projects and I feel the group projects are a much better
representation of real world environments.

For something interesting, my wife and I have been married for 14 years, but I have known
her almost my entire life.  Her mother and my mother were very good friends and I was
forced (much to my irritation at that time) to spend time with her.  In my late teens I didn't 
see her for several years.  After high school we both ended up working for AT&T.  We ran into 
each other one day and immediately hit it off.  We have been together ever since.  She still
teases me about sitting next to her in my mom’s van when we were kids and pointedly 
ignoring her.  Just proves that you never know what odd twists life has in store for you.
