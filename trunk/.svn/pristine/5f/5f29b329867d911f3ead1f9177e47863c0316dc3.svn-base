Hey, my name is Roel Palloj.

I began programming about 3 years ago when I started school at Valencia.
At the moment I currently work at Nuvolect as an Android engineer.  

Java is my primary language but I also know C, C#, and little bit of Objective C.

My hope for this course is to improve my skills as a developer.

I was born is Albania.
