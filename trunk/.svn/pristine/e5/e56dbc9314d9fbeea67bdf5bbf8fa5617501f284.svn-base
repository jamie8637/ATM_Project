Name: David Lawnicki



Background: 

I began my computer career by dissecting my parents' 80/86 when I was about 11 years old, and by running every DOS command I could find, just to understand what they did. This is how I figured out what FDISK did, and how to get DOS re-installed before my parents got home from work. 

I took a couple of computer programming classes in high school (BASIC and Pascal). I worked as a computer tech for a few years, hardware/software tech support for a few years, and then taught myself Delphi development. For about 10 years now, I have been working as a software developer. 

I am currently 33 years old, and the lead developer on all 20+ web apps and websites, and also do some of the Delphi development, for one of the top salon management software solutions.




Programming languages known: 

I have primarily developed using Delphi (10 years) and C#/.NET/HTML/CSS/JS (6 years). I have written a few desktop apps and Android apps in Java, a couple iOS apps (with Xamarin, not Objective-C), and have a little knowledge of C++ and VB from previous courses taken for my AS degree. 




What I hope to get out of this course:

Since I have always worked for smaller companies, and mostly as a lead, I know that I still have many things to learn about best practices, and what larger companies expect out of a software developer. I hope to learn as much as I can from Professor LaChance, since he has considerable real-world experience to back up what he is teaching. This will only make me a stronger developer.




Something "interesting" about me:

There is very little that is interesting about me, but here is what I've got. I have been with my fiance for over 5 years, and am getting married in February 2014. 

I am trying to teach myself guitar, so I have been spending at least an hour every night for about 6 months reading tabs, playing Rocksmith, and practicing chords. I realize that I have years to go before I'll even consider myself somewhat decent at it.
