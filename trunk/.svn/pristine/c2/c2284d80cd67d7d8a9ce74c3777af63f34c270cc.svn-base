Hello there everyone, the name is Michael Santiago. We're getting closer to the finish line! 

I have to say that I am truly joyous to begin with the course again though I have been brushing up
on my Java as of late after dabbling around with Web Design & Development over the Summer. I am close to finishing
up the degree with a small selection of courses remaining next semester. I truly enjoy programming in Java and would
probably say I'm entry level at the moment. Hoping that by the end of this course my software development prowess will shoot
sky high through diligent work and study of the concepts/assignments found in this course. 

I currently know Java, C, C++, C#, and Ruby. Of those all, Java and Ruby seem to be my biggest fields of interest and knowledge.
I am hoping to gain such an increase in knowledge in the field where a programming job may be acquired as a result. Aside
from the programming life, I like to draw. Lately I've been practicing my design work and have been incorporating it in 
Web Design. Learning through CSS alongside it has helped me appreciate the design aspect a lot more and there's still room
for growth. 

Let's do our best to really shine in this course!
