Name:
	Jeff Woodard
	
Background:
	I'm an experienced (older) software developer.
    I never completed my Bachelor's degree so I decided to return
    to school when I learned of the BAS-SD program.

Programming languages:
	Most of my recent experience is with Java. I also have experience with
    many of today's common technologies (e.g. XML, HTML, Web Service, etc.)

What I hope to get from the course: 
    A better understanding of software design principals, patterns, processes, etc,

Something unique:
	I think I'm farily typical for a software developer.  When I first starting programming
    many years ago, it was like an addiction for me.
