B. Hello Class, I'm from the great state of North Carolina, married (3 outstanding years) veteran of the US ARMY and now work as a software QA/Customer.

C. I’m most familiar with Java however I have dabbled a little bit with C in the past. Of course my goal is to get much better than I am now
D. I hope to gain some knowledge of Java + web programming. I hear a lot about Java EE and the opportunity (At least that’s what I see in job ads) for employment. Overall I just want to become a better developer than I am now.
E. I got an autograph signature from the great football hall of famer Barry Sanders! I met him when I was 13 years old
