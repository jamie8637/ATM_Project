I have always enjoyed programming. Years ago, I started as a physics major. For
various reasons, I dropped out of school for a while, completing my AA degree
at VCC some years later. I eventually decided to get an AS degree in
networking. Along the way I took some programming courses as electives, which
prompted me to change to a dual AS in networking and programming. Only during
my capstone did I hear about the BAS degree, which I decided to pursue. Now,
I'm only two semesters away from graduation. I'm a bit worries about moving
sideways in the job market, but I think I can make it work. My current job
maintaining servers and software for a web hosting company, doesn't have the
upward mobility I desire. Hopefully the BAS program will help me learn what I 
need to make the transition.

I've worked with Java, C++, C#, BASIC (Not VB!), VB, and various scripting 
languages. I am most proficient in Java and C#.

I hope to learn more about working with a group on a collaborative project. 
This includes planning, designing, and execution. Also, how to work together 
in a productive manner.

Hmm, something unique... I believe I can do anything. This may sound cocky, but 
I don't mean that I can sit down and bang out a million dollar program. What I 
mean is that I can learn and adapt as circumstances dictate, and that I can 
define and solve difficult problems.
