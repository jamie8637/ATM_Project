Hello all,

My name is Manuel Gutierrez, I have been in school for about 5 years now and I can't wait to finish this B.A.S degree.
I have done IT work, worked as a software developer, and I am currently working as a Software Engineer for QA. 
Soon to start an automation framework for one of the largest projects at my workplace. 

I have worked with Apex, Java, C#, JS, C++, and PHP. I wish to learn as much as possible from this course, specially
about best practices for software development and industry standards. 

I guess everything about me makes me unique. I am crazy enough to be working full time, going to school part-time, and
be in the middle of planning my wedding with only 4 months left! I am also a very friendly developer who doesn't mind 
performing tests, or writting code, I like doing both tasks. One is about creating and the other one about
breaking. Equally as fun if you ask me.
