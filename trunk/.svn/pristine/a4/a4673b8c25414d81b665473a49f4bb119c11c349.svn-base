Hello everyone. My name is Vandana Arora. 

I earned an AS degree in Database Administration from Seminole Community College and I am presently 
working on my Bachelors of Applied Science in Software Development. I have been a stay-at-home mom for the
last 7 years so I have limited work experience. 

My previous coursework has allowed me to learn COBOL, C++, Visual Basic, JAVA, and XHTML.

I am not only taking this class since it is one of the requirements to obtain my degree but also want to
acquire the skills to make me a productive member of a programming team before I head out back into the 
work force. 

Along with this class, I am taking 3 more classes this semester. It’s going to be a very busy semester for
me but I still hope to find some spare time everyday for my regular activities like exercising and walking.
