Your Name
Brief background
Programming languages you know
What you hope to get from the course
Something unique about yourself

Hi all, my name is Clarence "CJ" Matthews. I'll start with probably the most interesting bit about 
me as far as my classmates are concerned; I live in Des Moines, Iowa! I moved here last August for a 
full time position as a Quality Assurance engineer for a human resources software company that I was an
intern with for 6 months in Gainesville, FL. I have been programming for the past 5 or 6 years, working 
my way through the CP&A A.S. degree from Valencia, then through our beloved B.A.S. program. 

Languages I know is an interesting question...I'll list the languages I'm comfortable with, although 
I have been exposed to more during my time. I'm comfortable in C#, Java, Javascript, PHP, XHTML, XML,
and MySql. 

I hope to gain more experience developing software on a team and get more involved in actually writing and
maintaining code. At work I troubleshoot other people's code all day so I want to use this course to help
me better understand things from a developer's perspective.

something unique about me is the fact that I am extremely athletic. I play almost any sport that involves a
ball. In fact this semester, I am on an adult recreation softball team, flag football team, and soccer team.
I also am training to run a half marathon in October (which I am already dreading), and will probably end up 
on a basketball team in the winter. 

Lets have a great semester everyone, best of luck to us ALL!!
