Tamara McAndrew

I received my AS in Computer Programming from Valencia. I'm enrolled in the BAS Software Development program and will graduate next Spring.
 
I know Javascript, HTML, Java; learning PHP.

I haven't worked in the field yet so I want to gain experience working as a programmer and the expectations of the job.

I just moved to Fort Myers with my Husband.
