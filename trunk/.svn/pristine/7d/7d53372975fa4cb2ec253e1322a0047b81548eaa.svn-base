Hello everyone. My name is Silne Dorlus but I go by John. Professionally, I am a Software Development
Engineer in Test aka. QA Automation Engineer/Software Engineer for QA. QA Test Automation is 
an up and coming field and it is a good mix of QA and development skills. My role is to automate
tests and create tools/frameworks to facilitate and increase efficiency of testing by manual testers.

Programming Languages I am familiar with are:

.NET using C# and ASP.NET MVC, Java, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, XML, XSL-T, 
 MySQL, Entity Framework
 
 I am currently in the process of learning PHP.
 
 There are a few things I hope to get from this course:
 
Familiarity with Java for web development (specifically the Spring Framework),
more expertise with design patterns and software architecture, more familiarity with
the agile methodology in creating stories , etc. I would also like to learn why some 
shops choose Subversion over Git. ^_^ I have used both and have a strong preference for Git 
but I would like to learn the pros and cons to each.

I love having tea and gardening with my wife. I am creating a blog to help new graduates and
new IT professionals get into the industry and make the most of their opportunities.
It will be at www.thepowercoder.com but I am still working on it. Hasn't launched yet. I am 
also a new member on the Board of Advisors for the IT Programs at both Valencia State College and
Seminole State College. I am hoping to help them
