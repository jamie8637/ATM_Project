Currently a full-time software developer primarily working on website develop with Spring based projects CFI/Westgate Resorts.

My main language is Java but I am also familiar with C#, Apex, Some PHP and Javascript. There are other languages I've used but I'd don't consider myself knowledgable enough about them to mention it.

To continue along my path through school.
