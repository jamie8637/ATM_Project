Greetings everyone, my name is Adrian Rhodd and I go by Adrian.

This is my 2nd year here at UCF, like many of you I transfered in after graduating 
from a state college (Valencia). I'm currently interning with AAA out in Lake Mary as a developer and I'm getting some
pretty good experience working with Apache Maven and working with Java web applications. 
 
As far as languages go, I've limited my exposure to Java and some objective-C. But I plan on getting into C# aswell. 

I hope to get out of this course a solid understanding of building enterprise level Java applications.

Something unique about myself.. I'm just a guy trying to take care of his family..
