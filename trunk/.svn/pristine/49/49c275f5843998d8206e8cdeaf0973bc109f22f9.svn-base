Hello all My name is Aaron Bickhaus.

Background: I am currently a dot net developer and am in my second to last semester here at UCF. Like everyone else here
I am pursuing a BAS in software development. Before I came to UCF I was a fire fighter
in the Army. I did my four years and got out and decided to purusue another career path.

Programming languages: C++. C#, PHP, Java and various other scripting and non compiled languages

What I hope to get from course: I am on a mission to be a great developer. Anything that 
will help me get closer to achieving this goal I am game for.

Something unique about me: I love motorcycles and MMORPGS.
