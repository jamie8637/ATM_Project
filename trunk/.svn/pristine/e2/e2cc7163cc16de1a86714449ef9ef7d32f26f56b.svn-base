Hello everyone, my name is Michael Swift. I'm 25, started out my college career at Valencia College primarily as a Computer Science major, but switched over to Computer Programing and Analysis after talking to Dr. Archibald about the prospect of the Sotware Development degree, and so here I am now. 

Programing languages I have familiarity with include C, C#, Java, HTML, Javascript, XML, XHTML, Visual Basic, SQL, Bash and Unix script.

In this class, I hope to gain a continued understanding of the processess and procedure surrounding a real world development setting that prepares for work in the field. 

I'm a video game enthusiast, though that's probably not too unique in a course like this. I have four pets in my house hold. Three of them are dogs; a Dachshund/Corgi mix, Australian Shepard/Labrador mix, and a Saint Bernard. The last animal is a Squirrel that I rescued in it's infancy and hand raised but couldn't reintroduce into the wild due to him being fearless when it comes to dogs and humans. I'm also a life long Transformers fan since I was an elementary school kid.
