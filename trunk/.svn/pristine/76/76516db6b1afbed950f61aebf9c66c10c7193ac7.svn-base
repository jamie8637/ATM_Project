Hi Professor and fellow classmates,

My name is Eric, and IÕm happy to be joining you all for this class, and really excited that we're 
closing-in on completing our software development degrees! By the way, Eric is my middle (and 
preferred) name but Canvas only displays my first name.

After the absolute misery of my previous career (banking), I'm genuinely enjoying software 
development. For the better part of 3 years, I've been learning all I can to align myself with the 
most relevant opportunities. With this course, I hope to gain insight to the principles and 
standards applied to enterprise-grade software. The mid-to-long term goal is my own tiny 
(dog-friendly) development shop with a tiny pipeline of work.

Just over a year ago I started working as a developer for a company in Research Park, where I spend 
most of my time in R&D of mobile app concepts. Overall, I'm entry-level so there's plenty to learn. 
To date, most of  my code has been in Java, peppered with some SQL/SQLite database. I've traced some 
Objective-C tutorials in the past, but recently I've tried to get more familiar with it. The colons 
and square brackets are starting to make sense, I think. I've also been able to use the web 
technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for working cross-platform prototypes.

When IÕm not programming, IÕm spending time with my wife and our two young sons (about to start 
tee-ball!). These days are mostly filled with activities that we can enjoy as a family: the beach, 
amusement parks, or kids' birthday parties if we're lucky ;) When Grandma visits, my wife and I will 
make it to a concert, catch a comedy show, or sneak in some brown liquor tasting. I also follow 
baseball (St. Louis Cardinals) and college football (LSU) but I run out of time...

OK well, best wishes to everyone this Fall!
